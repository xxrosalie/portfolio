        <p>CSC486 is the class Computational Visual Narrative. This was a project-based computer science course that I took in my Junior year. 
          In this class, we created 4 video games within a group of atleast 3 people. Each game had to take place
          within the same narrative, so, game 1 started the story and game 4 ended the story. However, each game was different in the type of game it was.
          Game 1 was a narrative game, game 2 was a hidden object game, game 3 was a pinball game, and game 4 was a point-and-click RPG. 
          I was the artist of these games. You can see one piece of art for each of the 4 games to the right. I made much more art, but these are some of my favorites
          for each game.

          <p>HON314 is the class Society's Mirror: Literature in the 20th-Century America. This course studied many different key works of the 20th centry American literature.
            Analyzing these works required asking what they revealed about the society during the time that each work was produced. 
            One of the stories we read was Lusus Naturae, which I wrote an essay about. This essay can be seen to the left.

          <p>At the end of the semester, we had to practice our creative writing skills by writing a story that shows one of the themes we learned throughout the semester
            about society and literature. Olivia Smith and I wrote this story called Mirrored in Passing which can be seen to the left.

        <p class="class-title">CSC461</p>
        <p>CSC486 is the class Computer Graphics. In this class, we coded 5 projects using computer graphics tools and algorithms. Projects 1 through 4 were 
          practicing and learning basic computer graphics coding, such as raytracing, rasterization, shaders, textures, and transformations.
          Project 5 was to build a Battlezone game with the use of all the techniques we learned in projects 1-4. I made two versions of this game. 
          Version 1 is the regular arcade vector-graphics styled Battlezone game. The second version used OBJ models instead of vector-graphics. 
          I initially created OBJ models with textures, but coding the textures was not possible within the timeframe I had, so right now you can only
          see the non-textured OBJ models. My initial idea was to make it a candyland theme, so with lollipops as obstacles, pink tanks, and pink snowy mountains.
          The game is played by you, a tank, and you have to kill the enemy tanks before they kill you. If you get hit, you die, your score goes back to zero, and you 
          respawn in the original location. While alive, you can hit enemy tanks and each kill gets you 250 points. Both you and the enemies cannot hit through 
          obstacles or the mountains. There are always two enemy tanks on the battlefield at a time and they wander for about 6 seconds before turning to you to shoot. 
          I had a lot of fun creating this game and figuring out how I wanted all the game mechanics to work.

        <p class="class-title">GC420</p>
        <p>GC420 is the class Visual Thinking. This class was offered to all Computer Science students since visual thinking is an important skill for a computer scientist to have. 
          I personally also loved this class because each homework required drawing, which is one of my hobbies. Each week in this class, we would have to draw something different
          and use our creativity to make it different than the drawings of other students. Each drawing taught us another visual thinking technique. At the end of
          the semester, we had to choose one visual thinking technique/topic that we learned about throughout the semester and make a large art piece about it. My final project can be seen here.
          I chose to make it about the topic "Recentering" which explains that people tend to see every object, person, or concept in a stereotyped way at first, but if you recenter your brain, you can see
          other versions or aspects of the thing in a more creative way. I tried to show this process with a girl. The stereotyped version of her is drawn on the black paper, then the green "glitches" show the process of recentering
          how you view this girl which shows that you can also see her in other ways such as having curly hair, freckles, imperfections, etc. Neither view is "correct" but it shows that there are multiple ways of seeing things
          besides the stereotyped view you have when first thinking of it in your brain.

          <p>HON314 is the class Shakespeare and Leadership. In this class, we read a few of Shakespeare's stories, such as King Henry IV, King Henry V, Julius Caesar, and King Lear. 
            These stories were read in order to examine the characteristics of leadership within these stories and the importance of leadership within the societies in which these stories were written.
            Authority, responsibility, and accountability are three characteristics that were discussed to asses leadership. For this class, I wrote an essay on how each story depicts leadership. This essay 
            can be seen here.

          One of the amazing things about this class was the trip we got to take to Staunton, Virginia. We went there to see a Shakespeare play: Much Ado About Nothing. 
          Seeing this play in person made everything we learned in class even more interesting and it was a lot of fun to get to know my classmates better.

            the big project we did in a group of 6 people. Some images of the webpage are shown here. These are two pages that I designed and coded. The goal of this project was to create a website
            where an admin can login and hire staff, a staff member can login and add items to the inventory, add products to the catalog, and fulfill orders of customers, and customers
            can log in to browse the catalog, add items to their carts, and order the items in their cart. The process to create this website included a lot of planning, management,
            designing, implementing, and testing.

          <p>CSC281 is the class Foundations of Interactive Game Design. In this class, we played around with making multiple types of games such as puzzle and narrative games.
            The final project for this class was a game that we made in teams of 4. I was one of the artists for this game and the art for each of the levels that I made can be seen here.
            This game was an escape room puzzle game. There were two levels, which each have a light and dark side that can be switched between during gameplay. You need both modes to find all the 
            clues and ways to complete the puzzles and escape. When you escape level 1, you go to level 2. When you escape level 2, you finish the game.
