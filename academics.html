        <p>CSC486 is the class Computational Visual Narrative. This was a project-based computer science course that I took in my Junior year. 
          In this class, we created 4 video games within a group of atleast 3 people. Each game had to take place
          within the same narrative, so, game 1 started the story and game 4 ended the story. However, each game was different in the type of game it was.
          Game 1 was a narrative game, game 2 was a hidden object game, game 3 was a pinball game, and game 4 was a point-and-click RPG. 
          I was the artist of these games. You can see one piece of art for each of the 4 games to the right. I made much more art, but these are some of my favorites
          for each game.

        <p class="class-title">HON314</p>
          <p>HON314 is the class Society's Mirror: Literature in the 20th-Century America. This course studied many different key works of the 20th centry American literature point-and-click
            asked what they revealed about the society during the time that each work was produced. 
            One of the stories we read was Lusus Naturae, which I wrote an essay about. This essay can be seen to the left.

          <p>At the end of the semester, we had to practice our creative writing skills by writing a story that shows one of the themes we learned throughout the semester
            about society and literature. Olivia Smith and I wrote this story called Mirrored in Passing which can be seen to the right.
