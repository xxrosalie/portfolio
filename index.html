      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Rosalie and I am a Computer Science student at NC State University. 
          I chose Computer Science because I love the fact that it allows me to combine my technical and creative skills. 
          Computers have always interested me and I love solving all the puzzles that come with this major.
          During my time at NC State, I have been participating in the University Honors Program since Spring 2023.
          I have loved my time here. Here is my portfolio that shows all the achievements I have made during my years in the Honors Program!</p>
