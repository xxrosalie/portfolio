      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Rosalie and this is my portfolio. I am about to complete my bachelor's degree in May 2026 at North Carolina State University.
          I am majoring in Computer Science with the intent to go into Computer Graphics for my master's degree next year. 
          I chose Computer Science because I love the fact that it allows me to combine my technical and creative skills. 
          Computers have always interested me since I was a kid. I love solving all the puzzles that come with this major and the fact that it has such a global and innovative impact.
          During my time at NC State, I have been participating in the University Honors Program since Spring 2023. I have loved my time here and I will cherish all the memories I have made.
          Besides education and the honors program, I have also participated in two study abroad programs to Prague and Ireland, an internship at an AI startup, and a quantum computing research project. 
          Throughout this portfolio, I will discuss those experiences and also show some of my favorite projects that I have completed throughout my four years at NC State!
