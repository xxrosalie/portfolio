        <p>One of the amazing parts of the UHP is also the fact that they offer so many trips.
            In the fall of 2024, I got the opportunity to go to New York City, almost for free, with UHP.
            I saw so many sites and shows, tried foods, and made great friends.

        <p>Something else that I really enjoyed from the Honors Program is the accessibility to so many different cultural
            activities. I loved having the opportunity to also expand my cultural and social skills while still studying Computer Science.
            One thing that I loved was taking classes or crafternoons at the NC State Craft Center. I was first introduced to the crafternoons
            from honors events that we were required to take as a part of honors forum. I enjoyed them so much that I decided to take some classes myself.
            I have taken pottery classes wheel 1 and wheel 2, which I will show some photos of here.
