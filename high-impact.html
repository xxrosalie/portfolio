    <h2>Study Abroad in Prague</h2>

            <p>The first class I took when I studied abroad in Prague, was Astronomy.
                Prague was the perfect place to take this class because The Czech Republic had a lot of observatories that we could visit throughout our time there.
                My favorite project for this class was a presentation I made about exoplanets, which you can see here.

            <p>The second class I took in Prague was Food and Society. I thoroughly enjoyed this class because it gave me a chance
                to really learn about the food and culture of The Czech Republic. It also taught me so much about the history of food which
                I had never really thought about before.

            <p>Next to studying, my time in Prague was also filled with so much exploring, discovering, and trying new things.
                Here are pictures of some highlights of my trip.
