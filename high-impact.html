            <p>The first class I took when I studied abroad in Prague, was Astronomy.
                Prague was the perfect place to take this class because The Czech Republic has a lot of observatories that we could visit throughout our time there.
                My favorite project for this class was the final project which was a presentation I made about exoplanets, which you can see here. I loved having the 
                opportunity to take this class since I have always been interested in Astronomy, but it isn't really offered in my major. I learned so much and loved the way my teacher approached this class.

            <p>The second class I took in Prague was Food and Society. I thoroughly enjoyed this class because it gave me a chance
                to really learn about the food and culture of The Czech Republic while living there for 6 weeks. It also taught me so much about the history of so many different foods which
                I had never really thought about before. To the right, you can see a presentation I made about a topic we learned about in class, obesity vs. hunger.

            <p>In Ireland, I did an internship at a few AI startups at University College Cork. For one of these startups, I was given the task to 
              create an informative video to explain their palliative care product. I made a 1 minute video by scratch using stop motion mechanics and 
              my own digital art. To the right are a few scenes from the video. Besides creating this video, I also had some more technical tasks such as 
              coding data pipelines to transform and merge healthcare data. I also built a Python script that analyzes research papers and generates AI
              prompts and outcomes. Next to that, I tested multiple AI-driven products and websites. The combination of technical, creative, and professional 
              tasks made this internship so beneficial for my educational and personal growth.

            <p>One of the classes I took in Ireland was E497, which is Engineering Research Projects. In this class, we were required to write a research 
              paper related to our internships that compares something in Europe and the USA. I wrote about AI regulations in Europe vs the USA because the startups 
              I was working with were in their regulatory phases, so I could interview many coworkers to help with this paper. This topic was particularly interesting 
              for a comparative research paper since the AI regulatory frameworks are so different in the US and Europe.

    <div class="research-classes-container">
      <div class="research-row">
        <div class="research-class-block-1">
            <p>For about a year, I worked on a quantum computing research project alongside a professor at NC State University, Dr. Yuan Liu. 
              He hired me to start working on a new research project that he hadn't even started yet, so this was an opportunity for me to see the
              start of a project. I started by conducting a literature review to understand more about our topic, which was attempting to find a new 
              quantum algorithm to simulate differential equations with quantum speed-up. Quantum computers have the possibility to speed up solving 
              any problem that a classical computer can solve. The goal of this project is to find a quantum algorithm that can speed up solving 
              differential equations.<br>
              My tasks consisted of: 
              <ul>
                <li>Solving complex linear algebra and quantum problems</li>
                <li>Converting RLC dynamics into a Schrodinger Equation</li>
                <li>Conducting Hamiltonian simulations of the Schrodinger equation and the classical algorithm </li>
                <li>Comparing the classical and quantum simulations to find speed-up</li>
                <li>Coding in Qiskit</li>
                <li>Reporting my findings in a research paper using Overleaf</li>
              </ul><br>
              This project gave me the opportunity to practice doing research, write research papers, communicate professionally, and work with many professionals in the field.
